Terry Cosmetics - Weapons

In this repo are a selection of weapons that I have made for S&Box.

The assets made for Terry Cosmetics are assets that I try to fit Terry's cartoonish look. This can be clothes, models, materials and animations. Freedom to use these assets are provided so long as I (Kabubu) am credited for the work I have done.

Important Specifications:

- Viewmodel Camera Angle = 54 Degree(FOV) / 35.3mm(Lens)

- Each world model has varied LOD's for performace

- There are "tex" textures that have baked lighting accurate to blenders lighting in a neutral HDRI. These can be used without specular should that be needed.
